## Inspiration
At Lyra AI, we’ve seen seniors struggle with Parkinson’s, hearing impairment, and mobility issues that often lead to isolation. From walking the halls of Singapore’s Social Service Agencies, we realized that music could be a bridge—reigniting memories, joy, and independence. We wanted to create a platform where therapeutic sound and interactive play empower seniors to live fuller lives.

## What it does
Lyra AI is an interactive sound therapy platform for seniors. It combines AI-generated personalized music with engaging digital activities:
AI Lyric & Sound Synthesis: Generates therapeutic tunes tailored to each user’s needs.
Adaptive Piano Tiles: Customizable digital therapy that improves motor skills and cognitive agility.

## How we built it
Developed AI models for music and lyric generation.
Implemented adaptive gameplay for Piano Tiles to suit different mobility and cognitive levels.
Integrated user feedback loops to adjust music tempo, difficulty, and interactivity.

## Challenges we ran into
Balancing AI-generated music with therapeutic principles to ensure it is effective.
Designing a game interface that is intuitive and accessible for seniors with varying levels of tech literacy.
Adapting music timing and interaction in real-time for users with Parkinson’s or motor impairments.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Successfully created AI-generated personalized music tracks for seniors.
Built a functional adaptive Piano Tiles game to enhance motor and cognitive skills.

## What we learned
Technology can bridge the gap between healthcare and emotional well-being.
Direct user engagement is essential; seniors provide insights that no lab test can replicate.
Music is not just entertainment—it’s therapy, memory, and hope.

## What's next for Lyra 
*Rhythmic Auditory Stimulation (RAS) for Gait Training*
Given the strong evidence for Parkinson's patients, develop a walking companion feature that provides real-time rhythmic cues through headphones or speakers. Users could set their baseline walking pace, and the app generates metronome-like beats or music at their optimal cadence to improve gait symmetry and reduce freezing episodes.


*Voice Therapy Integration*
Many Parkinson's patients experience vocal softening (hypophonia). Add speech exercises set to music, singing therapy modules, and voice volume monitoring to help maintain communication abilities—directly addressing your mission to help seniors "find their voice again


*Binaural Beats Integration*
Binaural beats are created when two slightly different frequencies are played separately into each ear, causing the brain to perceive a third frequency equal to the difference between them. This auditory phenomenon may help guide brainwave activity toward states associated with improved memory, sustained attention, and deep relaxation.
Within our AI music composer, users will be able to select specific binaural beat frequencies to be seamlessly embedded into their personalized therapeutic music:

40 Hz (Gamma) – Associated with enhanced cognitive function and memory consolidation
8–12 Hz (Alpha) – Promotes calm focus and relaxed alertness
0.5–4 Hz (Delta) & 4–8 Hz (Theta) – Supports deep relaxation, meditation, and restorative sleep

This feature empowers seniors to tailor their sound therapy sessions to their immediate needs—whether sharpening mental clarity during the day or easing into restful sleep at night.
